@@@DATA STRUCTURE@@@@





The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of 
organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C 
language. Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one after another. 
In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is done 
with the help of an array of data structures. There are also other ways to organize the data in memory. Let's see the 
different types of data structures.

The data structure is not any programming language like C, C++, java, etc. It is a set of algorithms
 that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.

To structure the data in memory, 'n' number of algorithms were proposed, 
and all these algorithms are known as Abstract data types. These abstract data types are the set of rules.
